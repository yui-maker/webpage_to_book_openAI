# Motivation Letter with ChatGPT

I wanted to create some teaching materials based on information provided on a webpage. As the information was on the page across multiple links, I thought this will make it a good project for using AI. As for example I am using `https://www.learnpython.org/` and using AI to create teaching material for teaching Python to kids. I have also uploaded the sampel markdown file that was created during my experiments. 

## Steps to Get Started

### 1. Create a `.env` File
Save your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file. It should look something like this:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-********

### 2. Go to your Anaconda powershell and run the following command
`conda env create -f .\environment.yml`

### 3. lastly activate your new virtual environment with the following command
`conda activate motivation`
